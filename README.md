# Frontend Mentor: 3-Column Preview Card

### Challenge

- Build out a 3-column card component using provided [desktop](/assets/design/desktop-design.jpg) and [mobile](/assets/design/mobile-design.jpg)
- Users should be able to:
  - View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
  - See hover states for interactive elements

### Retrospective

- Another simple starter project
- Revisiting the code a year later, I found a few redundancies to refactor (_branch v2_), which had me curious about the original approach I took
- Though not a significant refactor or a noticeable difference visually, I see the update as a mark of refinement in my understanding web layout
- Update: Added animation to the card/column components (_branch v3_)
  - Animation is a feature I apply minimally--more from a lack of experience than of interest
  - It took a good while to figure out the keyframe sequence to have the cards/columns slide out at similar speeds or pace
  - Animating the SVG images [on each related button hover] called for JavaScript which wasn't an initial project criteria
  - I recognize the benefit of animation to enhance UI and user experience, so I plan to focus on learning and practicing by incorporating animation effects into future Frontend Mentor challenges

### Enhancement(s)

- Add animation
  - ~~Display of cards?~~
  - ~~SVG icons on button hover?~~
