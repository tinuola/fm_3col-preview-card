# Frontend Mentor: 3-Column Preview Card

Solution to the _[3-Column Preview Card Component](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/3column-preview-card-component-pH92eAR2-)_ challenge on Frontend Mentor.

### Challenge

- Build out a 3-column card component using provided [desktop](/assets/design/desktop-design.jpg) and [mobile](/assets/design/mobile-design.jpg)
- Users should be able to:
  - View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
  - See hover states for interactive elements

### Solution

### Retrospective

- Another simple starter project
- Revisiting the code a year later I found a few redundancies to refactor (_branch v2_), which had me curious about the original approach I took
- Though not a significant refactor or a noticeable difference visually, I see the update as a mark of growth/refinement in my understanding of web layout

### Enhancement(s)

- Add animation
  - Display of cards?
  - SVG icons on card hover?

### Tools & Resources

- HTML & CSS
- CSS Resets
- [CSS Tricks - Transition](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/t/transition/)
